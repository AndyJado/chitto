[Put all the files starting with same prefix in a folder in linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21859795/put-all-the-files-starting-with-same-prefix-in-a-folder-in-linux)



I have different files in some old data.

They are in the same folder.

They are grouped by the prefix.

I want to move all the files starting with the same prefix in a folder named with the same prefix.

Looking for a script which does it automatically.

EDIT 1 The script has to look by itself that how many prefixes are there and then group

Thanks
