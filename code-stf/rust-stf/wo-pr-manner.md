## Creating a Pull Request

---

"Release early and often!" also applies to pull requests!

Once your article has some visible work, create a [WIP] draft pull request and give it a description of what you did or want to do. Early reviews of the community are not meant as an offense but to give feedback.

A good principle: "Work together, share ideas, teach others."

#### Important Note

Please don't force push commits in your branch, in order to keep commit history and make it easier for us to see changes between reviews.

Make sure to Allow edits of maintainers (under the text box) in the PR so people can actually collaborate on things or fix smaller issues themselves.
