I was looking for a tool to **read** markdown file without leaving my terminal

`read markdown in terminal` I asked

google anwsered [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)

you gotta admit it looks rather promising with 10k plus stars

you gotta respect its UI looking as modern as fuck

and the one thing it does do is opening nothing but `.md` file

**but it won't render**

you literally reads `.md` file as is

All those little markups hanging there like a thousands-granny-tits'-dancing-party

and you read your markdown immersing in it

I just ain't able to swallow

why?

you 10k star holders

boolean-dead measurefagger

Anyway

that little tool I was looking for turns out to be `mdcat`

---

well `mdcat` only kinda works on `iterm2`

now I'm looking `termimad`

I kinda have to write some `fn main()`
