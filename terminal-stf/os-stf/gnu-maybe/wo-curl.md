I googled 'some website fun to curl'

I find [a-reddit-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/f1xx0e/list_of_sites_designed_for_curl/)

`$ curl cheat.sh`

it even got `zoxide` and `zellij`

it's like reading a book

so good man

try `$ curl cheat.sh/rust/impl`

# wonder

bash { 
  $1?
  cheat() { curl cheat.sh/$1 }?
};
