# faggy

my laptop threats burning itself to ash if I keep do what I do

we made a deal that me moving the heavy work to a remote server[^1]

I rent a cheap one from HUAWEI and I'm faggy about it

I do `ssh @129.31.0.12` where the IP address is made up because I cannot remember

and I blindly type my password `fff` which is not made up because I remember

I see `root` and I know I'm connected

it's a fake computer without a physical body so I don't have to develop any feeling for it

it something sad for faggy

so I dump my code to the server

I type in my command and it start running

writing all that result to the file I asked it to do

something like `cargo test |& tee ~/tilog.txt`

>just do your labour you labour

so I quit ssh and hours later I ssh back

I read my `tilog.txt` but it's not finished

that labour quit working the moment I quit ssh as well

> don't stop when I'm not sshing, faggot

I've been hearing tmux a lot and it kinda worked

keyword is `tmux detach attach session`

but tmux tastes old

I went `cargo install zellij`

# example

I started a new session named `0`

`zellij -s 0`

I give the command in zellij

`cargo test |& tee ~/tilog.txt`

I detach form zellij

`<C-o>`[^1] then `d` as instrument

I look at my stock and shit and drink vodka and when I came back

`zellij -a 0`

and that's it.
