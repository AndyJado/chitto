shebang

ctx

lhs

rhs

span

spawn

rc

I can go on but my is

naming caused most of my confusion

if I know shebang is hash#bang! #!

then my mind don't add a meaningless layer of abstraction

but it took me like month till I find in a random post what shebang actually is

with language server protocal

it seems easy to programmatically distinguish all the variables

therefore it's easy to impose my `intention system`
