Chinese words are declarative

writing one character is imperative

if we cracking the serialized stream of writing a Chinese word

then for strokes within its context

its rather simple to find a representative of an english `char`

Here is an example:

`每`

the first context reaches a `r`

follows a `c`

and a `J`

`rcj` already comes to a point where no other Chinese char would look like it

so we can sugar it

then 

`rcj` for `每`
