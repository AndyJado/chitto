I'd like to identify myself as a peasants' son

I wish I could say I am a peasant

But I just don't think I count

my grandparents did it their entire life

my parents did it until they were arranged jobs

I've never did it

`carrying the burden of being a peasant`

therefore

in this context

I would talk to you assuming you are my own kind
