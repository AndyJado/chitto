Lots of diagrams illustrating how git works with nodes and arrow

and arrows usually points to history from current

that is so (how to say...)-> fkn right!

cuz I would think arrow points to sth

namely I should look at the root and follow the arrow

which brings another frustrating concept

# start with 0 or 1?

if you land on pice of data

you must have a initial position

that's a zero

if you consume it

we have a 1
