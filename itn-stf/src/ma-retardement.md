so the other day I aboard on this train

and I went directly to wash my hand

but nothing came out that water tap

I got back to my seat waiting for the train to run

since that's how things work on a plane

I guess a train should have some break time as well

however nothing came out that water tap again

and another three taps

damn you train

I went through to the dinning booth for help be like

"I wanted to wash my hand, but there no water coming out"

"yes, there is"

She seemed bothered and said that with a end of conversation attitude

"But I.." I was going to argue

with my whole experience and my train-need-rest theory stuff

and she just switched

into this gentle and soft tone

like talking to retard

"let me show you, this way, come"

she present the whole process how water should came out of that thing

and she disappeared like a swift

oh I wish I get to be a retard all the time
