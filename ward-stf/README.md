## wa

I been used `wa` as prefix in my `chitto` for quite a while

not like 'yy' or 'la'

it's quite a certain one

I don't really know what `la` means

but I quite sure about `wa`

`what is`

`what the fa`

When my throat do these phrases **immersing in some confusion**

it goes like

`wa is`

`wa the fa`

## wa-rd

project a 0 rank tensor on intention gives a `word`

project a 1 rank tensor on intention gives a `line`

iz?

if the word itself && its location together represents the direction?

tensor! tensor!

you can make anything a direction

then you want sth to describe that

you use tensor

`wa iz this word`

`ward`
