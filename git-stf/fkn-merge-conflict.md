you started a `master branch`

you diverged into a `feature branch`

you worked on that featured one

you want to add `some feature` back to ur main branch

but your `feature branch` was originated on a poor base

so if you go back and modify that poor base to make it a better base

and then `git merge feature master`

you meeeeet conflict

fuck it

so you open a new `branch` and manipulate history

then pull that to your `master`
